# Simulation and RTL Outputs – Full Adder using Two 4:1 Multiplexers

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains the **simulation waveform**, **RTL schematic views**, and **design hierarchy diagrams** for the Verilog implementation of a **1-bit Full Adder** realized using **two 4:1 multiplexers**.

These visual artifacts confirm the **functional correctness** of the design and illustrate how the Verilog code is translated into **register-transfer-level (RTL) hardware** during synthesis in **Xilinx Vivado**.

## 📂 Included Images

### 1. Behavioral Simulation Waveform
Displays signal transitions for:
- `A`, `B` → Input operand bits  
- `Cin` → Carry input  
- `Sum` → Output sum  
- `Cout` → Carry output  

The waveform verifies:
- Correct **binary addition** for all 8 input combinations  
- Proper **Sum and Carry timing response**  
- Expected **pure combinational behavior** without clock dependency  

---

### 2. RTL Internal Schematic
Shows the synthesized **gate-level RTL structure**, including:
- Two instantiated **4:1 multiplexer blocks**  
- **Select line connections** driven by inputs `A` and `B`  
- Internal **AND, equality, and inverter logic** generated by synthesis  
- Signal routing that produces **Sum** and **Cout**

This view demonstrates how the behavioral Verilog description maps to **actual digital logic hardware**.

### 3. RTL Module View
Illustrates the **top-level structural composition**:
- Instantiated modules: `MUX_SUM` and `MUX_CARRY`  
- External inputs: `A`, `B`, `Cin`  
- External outputs: `Sum`, `Cout`  

Helps in understanding **module hierarchy and signal connectivity**.

### 4. Top-Level Design Block
Provides a simplified **design hierarchy representation** of:
- The **full_adder_mux** module  
- Input/output interface of the DUT  
- Overall synthesized structure used for simulation and RTL analysis
