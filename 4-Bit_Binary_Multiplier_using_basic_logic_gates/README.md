# 🚀 Project Showcase: 4-Bit Binary Multiplier Using Basic Logic Gates

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates the **design and implementation of a 4-bit binary multiplier** using only **fundamental logic gates** without any pre-built multiplier ICs.  
The circuit performs multiplication of two **4-bit binary numbers** and produces the correct **8-bit binary product output**, validating the principles of **combinational logic design and Boolean algebra**.

This project was successfully implemented and tested on a **breadboard**, ensuring accurate results for all possible binary input combinations.

## 🎯 Objective  
To design and implement a **4-bit binary multiplier** using only **basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)** without using dedicated multiplier ICs.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Components Used  
- **Breadboard**  
- **Logic Gate ICs:**  
  - 7408 → AND gate  
  - 7432 → OR gate  
  - 7486 → XOR gate  
  - 7404 → NOT gate  
- **Multimeter**  
- **Regulated DC Power Supply**  
- Connecting wires, resistors, and LEDs for testing  

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle  
1. Two **4-bit binary inputs** are applied to the circuit.  
2. **Partial products** are generated using AND gates.  
3. The partial products are combined using **XOR and OR gates** to perform binary addition.  
4. The final **8-bit output** represents the correct multiplication result.  
5. Hardware testing confirms accurate outputs for **all input combinations (0–15 × 0–15)**.
